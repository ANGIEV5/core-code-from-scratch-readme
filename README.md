We are in a room with three chests.
We know that at least one has a treasure in it.
Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.
left chest message "the middle chest as a treasure" 
Middle chest message "All of the chest have treasure in them"
Right chest message "only one of the chest have treasure"
The left chest is lying so the middle one does not have a treasure
the middle chest is lying because we know that the middle one does not have a treasure 
we know the right chest is lying so there is more than just one treasure.
we know the middle chest  does not have a treasure
So the left chest and the right chest have a treasure in it.
End.
